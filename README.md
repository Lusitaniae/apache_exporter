Exports apache mod_status statistics via HTTP for Prometheus consumption.

With working golang environment it can be built with `go get`.  There is a [good article](https://machineperson.github.io/monitoring/2016/01/04/exporting-apache-metrics-to-prometheus.html) with build HOWTO and usage example.

Help on flags:

```
  -insecure
    	Ignore server certificate if using https. (default false)
  -scrape_uri string
    	URI to apache stub status page. (default "http://localhost/server-status/?auto")
  -telemetry.address string
    	Address on which to expose metrics. (default ":9117")
  -telemetry.endpoint string
    	Path under which to expose metrics. (default "/metrics")
  -version
    	Version of the Apache exporter.
```

Tested on Apache 2.2 and Apache 2.4.

 If your server-status page is secured by http auth, add the credentials to the scrape URL following this example:
 
```
http://user:password@localhost/server-status?auto
```

# Using Docker

## Build the compatible binary
To make sure that exporter binary created by build job is suitable to run on busybox environment, generate the binary using Makefile definition. Inside project directory run:
```
make
```
*Please be aware that binary generated using `go get` or `go build` with defaults may not work in busybox/alpine base images.*

## Build image

Run the following commands from the project root directory.

```
docker build -t apache_exporter .
```

## Run

```
docker run -d -p 9117:9117 apache_exporter \
  -scrape_uri "https://your.server.com/server-status/?auto"
```

## Collectors

Apache metrics:

```
# HELP apache_accesses_total Current total apache accesses (*)
# TYPE apache_accesses_total counter
# HELP apache_scoreboard Apache scoreboard statuses
# TYPE apache_scoreboard gauge
# HELP apache_sent_kilobytes_total Current total kbytes sent (*)
# TYPE apache_sent_kilobytes_total counter
# HELP apache_cpu_load CPU Load (*)
# TYPE apache_cpu_load gauge
# HELP apache_up Could the apache server be reached
# TYPE apache_up gauge
# HELP apache_uptime_seconds_total Current uptime in seconds (*)
# TYPE apache_uptime_seconds_total counter
# HELP apache_workers Apache worker statuses
# TYPE apache_workers gauge
```

Exporter process metrics:

```
# HELP http_request_duration_microseconds The HTTP request latencies in microseconds.
# TYPE http_request_duration_microseconds summary
# HELP http_request_size_bytes The HTTP request sizes in bytes.
# TYPE http_request_size_bytes summary
# HELP http_response_size_bytes The HTTP response sizes in bytes.
# TYPE http_response_size_bytes summary
# HELP process_cpu_seconds_total Total user and system CPU time spent in seconds.
# TYPE process_cpu_seconds_total counter
# HELP process_max_fds Maximum number of open file descriptors.
# TYPE process_max_fds gauge
# HELP process_open_fds Number of open file descriptors.
# TYPE process_open_fds gauge
# HELP process_resident_memory_bytes Resident memory size in bytes.
# TYPE process_resident_memory_bytes gauge
# HELP process_start_time_seconds Start time of the process since unix epoch in seconds.
# TYPE process_start_time_seconds gauge
# HELP process_virtual_memory_bytes Virtual memory size in bytes.
# TYPE process_virtual_memory_bytes gauge
```

Metrics marked '(*)' are only available if ExtendedStatus is On in apache webserver configuration. In version 2.3.6, loading mod_status will toggle ExtendedStatus On by default.

## FAQ

Q. Is there a Grafana dashboard for this exporter?

A. There's a 3rd party dashboard [here](https://grafana.com/dashboards/3894) which seems to work. 

Q. Can you add additional metrics such as reqpersec, bytespersec and bytesperreq?

A. In line with the [best practices](https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/writing_exporters/#drop-less-useful-statistics), the exporter only provides the totals and you should derive rates using [PromQL](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/).

Q. Can I monitor multiple Apache instances? 

A. In line with the [best practices](https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/writing_exporters/#deployment), the answer is no. *Each process being monitored should be accompanied by **one** exporter*. 

We suggest automating configuration and deployment using your favorite tools, e.g. Ansible/Chef/Kubernetes.

Q. Its not working! Apache_up shows as 0

A. When apache_up reports 0 it means the exporter is running however it is not able to connect to Apache. 

Do you have this (or similar) configuration uncommented in your Apache instance?
```
<Location "/server-status">
    SetHandler server-status
    Require host example.com
</Location>
```
As documented at
https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_status.html

Are you able to see the stats, if you run this from the Apache instance?

`curl localhost/server-status?auto`

If you run the exporter manually, do you see any errors?

`./apache_exporter`

Please include all this information if you still have issues when creating an issue.
